# party-locator-video-game-forum

## Description

[Party Locator](https://github.com/CollyLee/p2-video-game-forum) is a video game forum that allows you to post tips, questions, and requests for playing partners to a message board. User must be logged in to post to the boards. It is set up to be later expanded to more video games because all of the data is coming from a back-end database that links games to forums. 

This would also allow for dynamic themes in future versions, tied to the genre of game that matches the current forum you are visiting.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. The website can be accessed [here](https://morning-spire-04153.herokuapp.com/games).

## Usage

Currently the Destiny 2 forum is the only one that is functioning. Expansion to other games coming soon! When you click on the Destiny 2 link, you'll see the main forum. Make sure to create an account to begin posting.

You can click the button at the top left ("Write a New Post") to add a post to the forum, providing a title and text body. Or you can click on an existing post in the forum to view what other players have to say.
